Setup is easy and takes less than a minute to complete. This guide lets you know what you're in for, and what to prepare for setup.




1 Dropbox folder
Cloud Sync uses the dropbox folder at "/My Dropbox/Apps/IVLE Cloud Sync/" to keep your ivle files. After setup, your files will be uploaded here, and you do not need to create it yourself.


2 Logging in
Cloud Sync requires access to your IVLE and Dropbox accounts. We neither require nor store your ivle or dropbox passwords. However, we do need you to grant Cloud Sync permission through the NUS IVLE website and Dropbox website.

<NOTE/Warning>
Currently, Cloud Sync does not support mapping one IVLE account to multiple dropbox accounts. If you have granted permission using two different accoutns, only the latest one will be used.


3 Selecting folders to sync

By default, Cloud Sync will sync all your folders. We do reserve the option to exclude certain folders or entire workbins to your liking (but why would you). Uncheck the folders you do not want, and Cloud Sync will not sync those folders.



Next Steps/Extra Information

Initial Setup
On the first run, Cloud Sync will download all current workbin files into your dropbox. This might take an hour or two, depending on how much files are already on the workbins. Subsequent synchronisations are much faster, between 5 to 10 minutes of any new file upload on IVLE.

Using the Cloud Sync folder
Cloud Sync lets you edit the files that are in your dropbox. In the event of an updated file from IVLE (e.g. your professor uploads a new assignment template), Cloud Sync renames the new template to avoid conflicting with your edits. We still recommend keeping safe backups of any work you have done.
