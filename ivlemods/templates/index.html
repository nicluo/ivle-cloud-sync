    <p>Dear IVLE Cloud Sync Users,</p>
    <p>The system has been reset for Semester 2 13/14. We are sorry for the two-week downtime at the beginning of the semester.</p>
    <p>Most users should have no problems with files getting to their Dropbox accounts. If you have removed the Cloud Sync folder over the school break, you may have to log in with your Dropbox account to get things started again.</p>
    <p>If you still have problems with your files, talk to us at <a href="mailto:ivlecloudsync@gmail.com"><strong>ivlecloudsync@gmail.com</strong></a> and we will personally look at your case, no issue is too small not to warrant attention!</p>
    <p>This section is relevant if you are taking modules from previous semesters/ you have similarly named folders in your IVLE Cloud Sync folder. IVLE Cloud Sync will upload files to the same folder if module names match. Please consider moving files to an archive folder before signing in to Cloud Sync again.</p>
    <p>In general, Cloud Sync will not affect other folders, nor will it delete files that belong to you.</p>
    <p>All the best for the coming semester!</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>
    IVLE Cloud Sync Team</p>
